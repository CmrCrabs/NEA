over the past 6 weeks i have: - learned and implemented the graphics library side of the renderer (alot) - learnt the theory behind FFT - completed a full refactor so the code is much nicer to work with

as refactor has been completed, most recent commit is functional, hopefully before the progress review I will have implemented dear imgui

repo: https://github.com/CmrCrabs/NEA/

I did not get any analysis feedback as far as I can see, I do still need to write up my objectives fully.
