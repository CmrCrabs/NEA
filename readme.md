# A real time physically based ocean simulation and renderer

I am nearly done learning a significant amount of esoteric math and signal processing and statistical concepts just so I can even begin to approach the algorithms behind this. I have done alot of work and am nearly there, everything that is currently within the document I actually understand, unless explicitly marked with "(Unfinished)".

I have had to learn alot of esoteric math, signal processing and statistical concepts to properly understand this. Everything not marked "(Unfinished)" I understand well enough
